"I already had a phone with problems... I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER...."
